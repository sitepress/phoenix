# Sitepress

This is NOT `sitepress-ex`; rather its a Phoenix app I'm using to learn my way around Elixir and Phoenix to potentially build such a library. I'm completely new to Elixir and Phoenix, so you will see me confidentiality try really stupid and naive things in this repo.

Why am I even interested in this? Phoenix has a really awesome templating system that I think could be a great way to build content sites, even if there's no dynamic piece of the application.

The reality is that most of us want to ship a dynamic application and have some content in the form of a small landing page, maybe some legal stuff, and support docs. I think this addition to Phoenix could be really compelling in terms of helping people quickly ship full applications to the interwebs.

Regardless of framework, I think its a huge missed opportunity for frameworks like Rails and Phoenix to not have content work out of the box. Sitepress intends on promoting the idea that a frameworks very first step in a "Getting Started" guide could be "Edit the home page at `./content/index.html.heex`".

## Getting started

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
